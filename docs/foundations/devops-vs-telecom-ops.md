# DevOps vs Traditional Telecom Operations

## Traditional Telecom Ops
- Hardware-centric mindset
- Manual change windows
- Reactive incident handling
- Scaling by adding boxes
- Limited visibility during failures

## DevOps Thinking
- Software-defined systems
- Automated deployments
- Fast feedback loops
- Horizontal scaling
- Observability-first approach

## Key Shift
DevOps is not about tools.
It is about reducing the time between failure and recovery.
