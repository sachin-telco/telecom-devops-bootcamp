# Interactive vs Non-Interactive Linux (DevOps View)

## Interactive Linux
- Human logs in via SSH
- Commands expect input
- Fixes are manual
- Changes may not be repeatable

## Non-Interactive Linux
- No human present
- Commands must not prompt
- Fully automated execution
- Repeatable and predictable

## Telecom Reality
Most outages are fixed interactively,
but true stability comes from removing humans
from routine operations.
